    "Vanessa ": "I now would like to take this time to think our presenters, John, Kevin and Krishna for delivering an outstanding session. And thank you to everyone for taking the time out of your busy schedules to join us for today's webinar, A Real World Case Study: Unifying Support and Service Experience With Customer Data brought to you by Technology and Services Industry Association and sponsored by SupportLogic. \nWe look forward to seeing you at our next TSIA webinar. Take care everyone. \n",
    "John Ragsdale": "I love that. I mean companies spend so much on quality monitoring programs and that usually means pulling an agent in and saying, two weeks ago you had this phone call and you could have handled it wells. And it's not really helping two weeks after the fact. \nSo I love the idea of the proactive coaching. Well we've got a couple of minutes left I know there's a lot of questions from the audience. Vanessa, do you want to ask a couple of the audience questions? \n",
    "Kevin Hodgkins": "Hey John I'd love to answer part of this question which is around some of the best practices of the division of labor between these teams. So the way I think about it is that the customer success team they're really responsible for that future state of the customer. \nThey're really responsible for helping ensure that customers can use and gain value from use of the software. How does that turn into some business goals? \nThat turns into things generally around retention and revenue growth. Our support team as I said earlier, they're focused more on the resolution of problems but they also address solutions. \nIf we think about that in concert with customer success and also with fee based professional services, our fee professional services are generally, they're scoped, there are deliverables that are part of that services contract. \nSo when we're engaged with PS, PS ends up doing a lot of support, a lot of frontline support. \nBut they also end up taking care of some issues that really have nothing to do with the scope of deliverables that they have. And our technical support team should be able to provide both resolutions and solutions to more point in time issues. \nSo I think that real way of focusing is that customer success is more forward looking, service is deliverable focused. And then our technical support does more to take care of the current state of the customer. \nAnd that goes beyond just the technical resolution. Even with a highly proficient technical team, you have opportunities to build with tools like SupportLogic, that ability to better serve, to think about the future state. \nTo think about the projects that are being worked on and the deliverables but to really focus on that good current state because otherwise the deliverables are harder to get out and the future state of that customer along their journey is not going to be as good without a solid current foundation. \n",
    "Krishna Raj Raja": "Yeah one of the fundamental things we are doing is the insights and intelligence our platform produces. In the past we have been only serving this to support managers, customer success managers, product managers and engineering managers. \nNow we are taking those insights and directly delivering that to support engineers themselves. So we are becoming basically an angel on the shoulders of support engineers gently nudging them and guiding them what they need to do with every interaction that they're having with the customers. \nAgain, this goes back to the fact of doing things in real time has a significant impact. If an AI is coaching you and giving you guidance on, hey this customer has expressed frustration in the past, you want to be careful here. \nThis case is likely to get escalated for such and such reasons you may want to focus on certain aspects of this case when you're interacting with this customer. That kind of a coaching especially now the AI is not only looking at this particular case but also looked at the previous cases this customers open. \nThat context can greatly change the way the support engineers interact with customers. We believe this is going to fundamentally change every metric that your organization is measuring whether it's MPS or CSAT score or churn net retention rate because it all starts with this fundamental interaction point that supporting engineers have with your customers. \n"

    "Judy Platz": "It is a journey. There's no doubt about it. And I agree with you. I don't want your CEO putting you out of business. I think you are a voice in this industry that's refreshing. \nI've enjoyed our conversation today so much, Steve. Thank you. Thank you for being our customer and for anybody who wants to know more about SupportLogic, don't hesitate to ask me, send a note directly or visit our website. \n",
    "Steve Blaz": "Sure. Well cybersecurity is unique to many of the industries I've been in, networking where bits are passing through and they can be redirected. \nI've been in compute where you can go to an alternative compute, I've been in storage where you can move storage easily and all of that stuff that the data moves or it gets rerouted or switched or changed direction. \nWith cyber security it either goes through cyber security or it doesn't. And if it does go through and it's bad, then bad things happen. \nAnd that becomes hyper critical. I would say this is the most critical set of work that I've ever been involved with in my career. \nAnd so for me to get ahead of that so that I can help, because we don't have a lot of monitoring because cybersecurity customers don't want monitoring on their systems. They don't want telemetry. \nWe're making some inroads as a company into that to try to be more predictive. As a conversation I have with my CEO, he's like, Blaz, I'd like to put you out of business. \nAnd I'm like, Whoa, what are you talking about? But he is right. If we were a company that could be ahead of any issues that any customer would ever have, you wouldn't need a support organization. \nNow rest assured, I'm pretty confident I will be around in my job for a long time, as will any other, the support folks in the world. But we're thinking about that, how we can get ahead of that. \nBut the first steps are being able to understand the customer situation, get them out of it as quickly as possible. Then we're going to be moving more into what can we get from our systems, our tools, whether it's software, it's hardwares, virtual, whatever, however it manifests itself and get ahead of that so that we prevent that from ever happening. \nI think that's still a direction, still a North Star for many, many companies to continue to follow and get to that nirvana, if you will. \nIt's definitely a journey. \n"

    "Vanessa Lucero": "Absolutely. So Judy just mentioned on the left- hand side, you've got a resources box, and those top two links are going to be the paper that John mentioned here, The Current and Future State as a Voice and Sentiment Analysis along with the SupportLogic webinar coming up here with Rebecca and Joe Andrews from SupportLogic as well. \nSo please don't forget to click those buttons. And with that being said, thank you to everyone for taking the time out of your busy schedules to join us for today's live webinar, Aligned Support and Success with Actionable Account Health Scores brought to you by Technology and Services Industry Association and sponsored by SupportLogic. \nWe look forward to seeing you at our next TSIA webinar. Take care, everyone. \n",
    "John Ragsdale": "Yeah, I think that could be. The sentiment analysis paper, I mentioned, the big case study in there is from HPE and it's about on- premise technology products. \nSo all of that data and metadata around cases doesn't matter. It could be consumer products. It could be hardware. It could be software. \nI think that software companies are probably more focused on renewal, but obviously there's a lot of value from mining the support experience beyond SaaS renewals. \n",
    "Judith Platz": "Vanessa, can we remind that the resources to access John's paper and if people are interested in that business case webinar, left- hand side of the screen under resources to make it easy for everybody here with us today to walk away with those two assets? \n"

    "Martin Schneider": "Great. Well, I think we got to everyone's questions. Great questions. Thanks for attending. Thank you FT, thank you Jono. \nLike I said, you can always email me if you'd like to see more or maybe even schedule a demo to see some of the other feature sets at martin@ supportlogic. io. Again, thank you all for attending. \nWe'll be sending the archive of this out to you all shortly. Thanks a lot. \n",
    "Francoise Tourniaire": "Okay, so first of all, don't despair. Secondly, create a process. We gave plenty of examples. Create a process and work the process. I once inherited a team where you remember as I said a good backlog is two weeks' worth. \nWe had about two months, we had cases with birthdays. We celebrated the birthdays as a joke, right? So it was pretty bad, and within six months, we got to a two week level. \nSo it's possible. There were days when I doubted, but it's possible, just start with what you have and just ratchet down slowly. You will get there. \nTrust the process. Just do it every week and good luck. \n",

    "Joe Andrews": "I love that analogy, Rebecca. Thank you. Why don't we leave off here. As I mentioned, please go and take advantage of some of the resources you see here in the doc section. \nGo to supportlogic. com/ resources. And feel free to get in touch with us either directly or through our website. We would love to have a conversation with you. I really appreciate the insights here today, both from your research, Rebecca, and also Judy, from your own experience directly and advising many clients. \nThank you both and thanks everyone for joining us. \n",
    "Rebecca Wettemann": "Thanks everyone. Have a great day. \n",
    "Judith Platz": "It's not a case management tool. So you're not taking out your significant investment in Salesforce, Zendesk, ServiceNow, FreshWorks. \nYou are putting SupportLogic down on top of that. And SupportLogic is looking at what's in your case management system. It's supplementing in an amazing way. \nIt's giving you an interface for managers who may not go into the service console on a regular basis. So it's serving up for you on top of. \nSo it's an intelligence layer, and I am careful about that in conversations that I had before and now, as the chief customer officer here. \nThis is an add- on to what you already have. Not to say, however, other systems that you have could in fact be replaced, and I'll use a CSAT survey as an example. \nOnce you're getting your customer sentiment prior to a satisfaction survey, do you need those satisfaction surveys? It's a good question. So you could replace that. \nYou could replace other tools in the stack, but we're not replacing your case management system. We're simply enhancing it. \n"
